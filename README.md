this is a window that has buttons on it that change its geometry. I created this for two purposes:

1. to familiarize myself with xlib's graphics system

2. to have a window to easily test my window manager's responses to client requests to change their geometry

that is all.

dependencies:

* xlib header files

* gcc ig
